There was a short time when I was planning to use Python for the edge device base image. I still refer to these files from time to time to quickly getting a FastAPI app going for other tasks. 

Why Go over Python?
1. Go's concurrency > Python GIL
2. Type safety
3. Compilable, easier to distribute to lower powered edge devices
