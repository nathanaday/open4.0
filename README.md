# open4.0

### Overview

Open4.0 is an open-source framework for intelligent IoT applications. Specifically, it is tailored to managing data analysis pipelines, including AI/ML models, for both cloud and edge computation. Paired with an extremely easy plug-and-play device layer, it's easier than ever to send intelligent, AI-informed insights to an output of the user's choice--whether that is to a data historian, 3rd party service, or a live dashboard.

### Open4.0 Cloud

The Open4.0 cloud container includes everything needed for building a real-time data monitoring and fleet management application
- Customizable data dashboards
- Cloud computing pipelines based on defined analysis models, including AI/ML
- Event-driven actions based on uploaded data
- Data and event forwarding to 3rd party services over web hooks, HTTP, MQTT
- AI/ML sandbox for model fine-tuning and testing
- Device management, including pushing over the air firmware updates and AI/ML models

### Open4.0 Edge

Framework for building data ingestion instances around existing sensor devices. Early support will include cameras, temperature sensors, accelerometers, and GPS devices. The edge framework allows any developer to build featured plug-and-play devices:
- Local web app over network interface for device configuration tasks
- Exposed real-time API for advanced data handling
- Load and update edge AI models
